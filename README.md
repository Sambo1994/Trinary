The TrinaryUnit class represents the trinary unit.
The process_data method takes input data and determines whether it's negative, positive, or neutral based on the rules provided.
The run method accepts a stream of data and processes each element in the stream.
For each "01" input, it either chooses a random value if it's the first in the sequence or returns the same value as the previous data.
In this code:

TrinaryUnit represents the trinary unit as previously defined.
CPU represents the central processing unit of the virtual computer. It contains registers and a program counter, and it executes instructions fetched from memory.
Memory represents the memory of the virtual computer. It stores the program instructions and data.
main() function sets up the virtual computer by initializing the trinary unit, CPU, and memory. It also loads a sample program into memory and executes it.
